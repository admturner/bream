/**
 * Read Me First
 *
 * WordPress requires a style.css stylesheet in the root directory of the theme,
 * not in a subdirectory. So here is the main stylesheet for the Empty theme.
 * However, **this stylesheet IS NOT USED on the site itself.** This is simply
 * a human-readable version auto-generated by the Sass build process. (See the
 * README file for more information).
 *
 * The actual stylesheet for the Empty theme is a minified, human-unreadable
 * version in `assets/css/`. If you want to make changes to the CSS of this
 * theme you need to edit the .scss files found in `src/assets/scss/` then run
 * the Sass npm build process.
